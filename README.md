# Figma Substitute --- another find & replace plugin

## Why?

- The two main _find and replace_ plugins that are available don't offer a good experience.

## Goals

- If no frame is selected, find/replace all occurences on the page
- Offer complete (or what is available through JS) Regex support
- Under consideration: use a simple `s/find/replace/flags` string format
- Learn the Figma API
