# Figma Substituteâ€” another find & replace plugin

:warning: This plugin is under development :warning:

## Why?

I have yet to find a community _find and replace_ plugins that handles selection context and has Regex support. This plugin attempts to address both of those needs.

I'm essentially trying to create find/replace with an experience similar to InDesign and text editors like Sublime.

## Goals

- Selectively find text inside selection, or all text on the page
- Offer complete (or what is available through JS) Regex support
- Learn the Figma API

## TODO

- [x] Find all text on page if nothing is selected
- [x] When there is a selection, only find text inside that area
- [x] Add edit text functionality
- [ ] Add `figma.ui` library for the plugin front-end
- [ ] Add find/replace functionality
  - [x] Add UI form for find/replace
  - [x] Pass in user find string
  - [ ] Pass in user replace string
  - [ ] "Find" selects next match
  - [ ] "Find all" selects matches
  - [ ] "Replace" next match
  - [ ] "Replace All" matches
- [ ] Add regex functionality
  - [x] Add regex search function
  - [ ] Add regex replace function
  - [ ] Add regex search flags function: ignore case, global, etc
  - [ ] Look into how to support positive/negative look-ahead and behind
  - [ ] Add regex UI toggle and flags
- [ ] Add visual feedback for search selection. Some potential solutions:
  - Underline the text range
  - Change the color of the text range
  - Overlay some sort of element at the exact XY coordinates of the element
    - caveats:
      - Would have to append to the root to avoid interfering with frame autolayout
      - Would have to recreate the string, split it into groups, color the match, and then turn the non-matching groups transparent
- [ ] Keep styles for textNodes with mixed fonts/sizes/weights
- Look into using [`getStyledTextSegments`](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/properties/TextNode-getstyledtextsegments/)
- Save UI state to storage
